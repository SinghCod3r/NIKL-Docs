# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through installing the NIKL compiler and running your first program.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have **Node.js (version 18 or higher)** runtime installed on your system.

### Install the Compiler

You can install the official NIKL compiler globally using npm (Node Package Manager).

```bash
npm install -g nikl-lang
```

To verify that the installation was successful, run the following command in your terminal.
```bash
nikl --version
```
It should print the installed version number.
